 So parts 1-3 work flawlessly (or at least I have not been able to break it yet) and part 4 is semi working. I can
 get them to rotate but cannot seem to get them to do so consistently, as well as the bounding boxes do not change
 and then click locations do not either. Then I guess the copy, cut, paste does not preserve the rotation but that
 is more a problem with the rotation rather than the copy, cut, paste. If I saved the values properly I could easily
 be deep copying them.

 Anyway, besides that it should all be good. Thanks for a fun term, I definitely learned a lot and feel much more
 confident in my programming on account of this assignment. Sorry for all the comments in there but decided to go
 all in because I had the time!

 Happy Holidays
